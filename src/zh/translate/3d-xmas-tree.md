#3D Xmas Tree

A 3D Christmas tree PCB with red LEDs controlled by the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins: can be used as a programmable Christmas decoration. Available as a DIY soldering kit, or pre-soldered.

Features 24 GPIO-controllable red LEDs (simple digital outputs on the relevant GPIO pins), and 1 GPIO-controllable yellow LED as the star.
