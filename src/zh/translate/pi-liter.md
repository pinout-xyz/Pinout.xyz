# Pi-LITE-r

The Pi-LITEr is a fully assembled add on board for the Raspberry Pi. It has 8 ultra-bright white LED's on a board which plugs directly onto the GPIO header. It can be used alongside other I/O projects to give status indication. Lighting all 8 LEDs consumes a tiny amount of current, less than a single standard LED (which is 20ma nominal vs 14.4ma for the Pi-LITEr).

## Applications

* I/O status indicator
* Bar graph
* Light chaser
* Activity indicator
* Lighting effects

## Code

```python
from gpiozero import PiLiter
from time import sleep

lite = PiLiter()

for led in lite:
    led.on()
    sleep(0.1)
    led.off()

lite.on()
sleep(5)
```
