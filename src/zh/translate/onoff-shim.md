# OnOff SHIM

The OnOff SHIM is a convenient power switch for the Raspberry Pi. Designed to be soldered straight onto the GPIO pins of your Pi, you can use it alongside HATs and pHATs while retaining a very compact setup.

To setup the daemon responsible to initiate the clean shutdown, simply run:

```bash
curl https://get.pimoroni.com/onoffshim | bash
```

## Features

* 1mm thick PCB
* can be soldered right onto the Pi header
* corner-mounted push button for on/off
* micro-B connector for power supply
* red status LED
* optional breakout pins to connect an external momentary button
