# Pinout!

### The comprehensive GPIO Pinout guide for the Raspberry Pi.

This GPIO Pinout is designed to be both a quick and interactive reference to the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins, plus a comprehensive guide to your Raspberry Pi's GPIO interfaces. It also includes [dozens of pinouts for Raspberry Pi add-on boards, HATs and pHATs](/boards).

## Support Pinout.xyz

If you love Pinout, please help me fund new features and improvements:

Every $1 makes all the difference! Thank you.

## pHAT Stack

Pinout has teamed up with Pimoroni to create a [prototype board compatibility tool, check it out here!](/phatstack)

## Explore HATs & pHATs

We've [added a board explorer](/boards)! Use it to find the pinout for a Raspberry Pi add-on board, or discover new ones. If you manufacture boards, we'd love to add yours too. [You can contribute over on GitHub](https://github.com/gadgetoid/Pinout.xyz).

## What do these numbers mean?

* BCM - Broadcom pin number, commonly called "GPIO", these are the ones you probably want to use with RPi.GPIO and GPIO Zero
* WiringPi - Wiring Pi pin number (shown as a tooltip), for Gordon Henderson's Wiring Pi library
* Physical - Number corresponding to the pin's physical location on the header
* Rev 1 Pi - Alternate BCM numbers for the original, 26-pin model "A" and "B" Pi

## What's the orientation of this pinout?

Pinout depicts pin 1 in the top left corner. Pin 1 is the only pin with a square solder pad, which may only be visible from the underside of your Pi. If you orient your Pi such that you are looking at the top with the GPIO on the right and HDMI port(s) on the left, your orientation will match Pinout.

## Graphical Pinout

We've whipped up a simple graphical Raspberry Pi GPIO Pinout. Feel free to print, embed, share or hotlink this image and don't forget to credit us!
