# Coral Environmental Sensor Board

The Coral Environmental Sensor Board adds multiple environmental sensors and Grove connectors for external devices. It works with all 40-pin Raspberry Pi variants as well as the Coral Dev Board.

## Features

* 128x32 OLED Display (SSD1306-based SPI interface)  
* Ambient light sensor (OPT3002, 0x45 on i2c bus)  
* Barometric pressure sensor (BMP280, 0x76 on i2c bus)  
* Humidity / temperature sensor (HDC2010, 0x40 on i2c bus)  
* Crypto-processor with Google keys (ECC608, 0x30 on i2c bus)  
* Four Grove connectors:  
    1x UART  
    1x I2C  
    1x PWM  
    1x 3.3/5V analog (using TLA2022 ADC, 0x49 on i2c bus)
* General purpose button  
* General purpose LED
