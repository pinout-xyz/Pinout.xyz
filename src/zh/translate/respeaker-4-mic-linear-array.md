# ReSpeaker 4 Mic Linear Array

This HAT comes with 4 microphones and is designed for AI and voice applications; integration with Amazon Alexa Voice, Google Assistant, and so on. It consists of two boards: the voice accessory HAT, and the four microphone linear array. It supports 8 input and 8 output channels in Raspbian/Raspberry Pi OS. The first 6 input channels are for microphone recording. Only the first 4 input channels are valid capture data, the remaining 2 input channels are an echo channel for playback. The first 2 output channels output stereo audio, the remaining 6 are unused.

## Features

* MIC: 4 Microphones
* AC108: 2 4-channels ADC
* AC101: a 2-channels DAC
* Raspberry Pi 40-Pin Header
* I2C: Grove I2C port, connected to I2C-1
* GP12: Grove digital port, connected to GPIO12 & GPIO13
* JST 2.0 SPEAKER OUT: for connecting speaker with JST 2.0 connector
* 3.5mm AUDIO JACK: for connecting headphone or speaker with 3.5mm Audio Plug
