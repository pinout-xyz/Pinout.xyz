# pi-topPULSE

The pi-topPULSE is a Raspberry Pi HAT and a pi-top/pi-topCEED compatible add-on board comprising of a 7x7 LED array, a speaker and a microphone. Additionally the device features ambient lights: 4 around the speaker, and 3 on the underside.

The speaker uses I2S, and the LEDs and microphone use serial (UART) - Tx and Rx respectively. A PCA9570 IC is exposed at I2C address 0x24, which allows for enabling/disabling/probing the on-board speaker, MCU and EEPROM as well as toggling the microphone sampling rate between 16KHz and 22KHz.
