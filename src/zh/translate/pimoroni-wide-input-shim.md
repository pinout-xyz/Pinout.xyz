# Wide Input SHIM

Wide Input SHIM lets you use a range of different DC power supplies with your Pi, including the ubiquitous 12V barrel jack power supplies. It's super-skinny, so you can solder it straight to your Pi's pins and still use HATs and pHATs on top.

## Features

* 0.8mm thick PCB
* Can be used with HATs and pHATs
* 3.5mm outer diameter barrel jack connector (centre positive)
* Adapter cables included
* TPS630701 buck-boost converter chip
* 5V / up to 2A output
* 3-16V input (DC)
* Reverse voltage protection
* EN (enable) pin to switch off output voltage (pull to ground)
