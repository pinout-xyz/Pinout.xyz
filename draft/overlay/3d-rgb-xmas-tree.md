#3D RGB Xmas Tree

A 3D Christmas tree PCB with RGB LEDs controlled by the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins: can be used as a programmable Christmas decoration.

Fantastic for Christmas making or as a superb stocking filler for the lucky geek in your life, the RGB Xmas Tree features 25 super-bright, individually addressable RGB LEDs to create your own festive frenzy of colourful blinkyness!

Control each LED individually with your code - change the colours, set the brightness, fade the light in and out or turn them on and off. 
Combine all of this to create an impressive light show limited only by your imagination.
