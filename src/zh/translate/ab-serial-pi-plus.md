# Serial Pi Plus

The Serial Pi Plus is a UART to RS232 serial converter for the Raspberry Pi.

The RS232 port is connected to the UART port on the Raspberry Pi using a MAX3232 interface. The MAX3232 IC converts the 3.3V UART port to RS232 voltages allowing communication with RS232 compatible devices over a DB9 serial cable or with the use of a null-modem cable the board allows terminal access with linux on the Raspberry Pi using a terminal application. The RS232 port can be accessed through the DB9 port or the solder points on the PCB.

## Features

- RS232 Master Port.
- Control the Raspberry Pi over RS232 or connect to external serial accessories.
- Stackable with other Raspberry Pi accessory boards.
- Mounting holes for use with the AB Electronics UK mounting kits (sold separately)
