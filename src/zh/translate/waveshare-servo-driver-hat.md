# Servo Driver HAT

Standard Raspberry Pi 40PIN GPIO extension header, supports Raspberry Pi series boards.
I2C controlled, using only 2 pins, up to 32 different addresses, enabling to stack the same number of boards. They are selectable by de-soldering the resistances and solder on pins A0..A4. 

## Notes

* The PCA9685 A5 pin is soldered to GND so you can't use the  other 32 possible addresses offered by PCA9685.
* Also the i2c 0x70 address is present, if you run `i2cdetect -y 1`. That's because the PCA9685 uses that address to send data to all the devices of the same model.

## Features

* stackable, up to 32x.
* Up to 16-Channel servo/PWM outputs, 12-bit resolution for each channel (4096 scales).
* Integrates 5V regulator, up to 3A output current, can be powered from battery through VIN terminal.
* Standard servo interface, supports common used servo such as SG90, MG90S, MG996R, etc.
* Available development resources and manual on wiki (examples in python like Bluetooth/WiFi remote control).
