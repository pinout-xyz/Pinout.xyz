# TODO

Replace WiringPi code examples with equivilent, and much more useful RPi.GPIO examples.

Add pin setup to overlays- IN/OUT, plus polarity Active HIGH/LOW

Add PNG renderer to turn JSON overlays into usable pinout images

Change pincount to useful figure that details compatibility - HAT, 26 pin, etc

Remove "exclusive" from JSON since all defined, non-i2c or SPI pins will be exclusive anyway
