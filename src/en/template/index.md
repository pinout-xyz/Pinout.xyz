#Pinout!

###The comprehensive GPIO Pinout guide for the Raspberry Pi.

This GPIO Pinout is designed to be both a quick, interactive reference to the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins, plus a comprehensive guide to your Raspberry Pi's GPIO interfaces. It also includes dozens of pinouts for Raspberry Pi add-on boards, HATs and pHATs.

##Latest Pinout news

We've [added a board explorer](/boards)! Use it to find the pinout for a Raspberry Pi add-on board, or discover new ones. If you manufacture boards, we'd love to add yours too. [You can contribute over on GitHub](https://github.com/gadgetoid/Pinout.xyz).

##What do these numbers mean?

* BCM - Broadcom pin number, commonly called "GPIO", these are the ones you probably want to use with RPi.GPIO and GPIO Zero
* WiringPi - Wiring Pi pin number (shown as a tooltip), for Gordon Henderson's Wiring Pi library
* Physical - Number corresponding to the pin's physical location on the header
* Rev 1 Pi - Alternate BCM numbers for the original, 26-pin model "A" and "B" Pi

##Graphical Pinout
