# MotoZero

The MotoZero is a simple Raspberry Pi motor controller add-on board that lets you control up to 4 motors independently.
With simple GPIO control and its very own GPIO Zero library entry, it's one of the easiest ways to control lots of motors on your Raspberry Pi.

## Features

* Control 4 motors independently in both forwards and reverse
* Control with basic GPIO 'on/off' code, or using GPIO Zero library
* Terminals break out the motor outputs to the edge of the board
* Built-in flyback voltage protection diodes
* Suitable for all 40 pin Raspberry Pi models
