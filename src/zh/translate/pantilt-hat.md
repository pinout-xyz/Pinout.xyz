# Pan Tilt HAT

Pan Tilt HAT is a two-channel servo driver designed to control a tiny servo-powered Pan/Tilt assembly. It also controls either PWM-dimmed lights or WS2812 pixels; up to 24 RGB or 18 RGBW.

Pan Tilt HAT uses a PIC16F1503 with custom firmware, and talks over i2c.

To get the HAT set up and ready to go you can use the one-line product installer:

```bash
curl -sS https://get.pimoroni.com/pantilthat | bash
```

Then import it into your Python script and start tinkering:

```bash
import pantilthat
```
