# PiGRRL Gamepad

The PiGRRL Gamepad PCB is designed for use in portable gaming projects like the PiGRRL 2 but it's basically a set of buttons wired between ground and select GPIO.

All button inputs should be configured with their corresponding internal pull-ups. Note that there are no protection circuitry, so be sure not to drive the GPIO high and short them to ground via button actions!
