# Tentacle T3 for Raspberry Pi

This Raspberry Pi add-on board is stackable. Each Tentacle T3 can host up to 5 EZO-class devices from Atlas Scientific to measure PH, Dissolved Oxygen, Electric Conductivity (E.C.), Oxidation-Reduction Potential (ORP) temperature (RTD) and control dosing pumps (EZO-PMP). The EZO devices must be in I2C mode. All I2C addresses can be set dynamically.

## Features

- 2 fully isolated channels for Atlas Scientific EZO Circuits
- 1 non-isolated channel Atlas Scientific EZO RTD Circuit
- 2 additional I2C channels for EZO 5pin-sensors and 3rd-party I2C devices
  - works with the EZO-PMP embedded dosing pump and EZO-CO2 NDIR Co2 sensor.
I2C only

Built in electrical isolation means that sensors wonâ€™t interfere with each other. It also removes outside electrical noise that can interfere with readings.
