# Monarco HAT

Manufactured by Monarco Solutions Group / REX Controls s.r.o., the Monarco HAT is is an all-in-one solution for using Raspberry Pi in industrial automation. It provides analog and digital inputs and outputs as well as RS-485 and 1-Wire communication interfaces. In fact, it turns the Raspberry Pi into a PLC or a mini industrial PC (IPC) ready for use in your automation project.

All the inputs and outputs are designed to directly interface standard industrial sensors and devices, eliminating the need for additional hardware. 

## Features

- **Power supply: 10-30 VDC**, powers also the Raspberry Pi
- **4x digital IN, 3.5-30 VDC**, optical isolation, common GND
    - 2x counter (pulse/DIR) or 2x encoder (A/B), up to 200 kHz
    - Counter values retention during power off
- **4x digital OUT**, open-drain, max 40 VDC, 1 A per channel continuous
    - All with up to 100 kHz PWM
    - Short-circuit protection (continuous)
- **2x analog IN**, 0-10 V / 0-20 mA, 12-bit
    - Electronic switching of voltage/current sensing mode
    - Protected against over-voltage and reverse polarity
    - 500 Hz bandwidth, configurable filter
- **2x analog OUT**, 0-10 V, 0.5 ms settling time, 12-bit
- **1x RS-485 bus** with ESD protection
- **1x 1-Wire bus** with ESD protection
- **9x LED indicator**, by default mapped as indicators for digital inputs and outputs and system status, user controllable
- **High quality push-in terminals**, detachable connector
- **Battery-backed RTC chip** for keeping the track of time
- **Hardware watchdog** for power-cycling the Raspberry Pi in case of failure
- Compatible with the **Raspberry Pi 7â€œ official touchscreen** (on-board connector for powering the display)
- **EMC tested, CE marked**
