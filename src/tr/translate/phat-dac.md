# pHAT DAC

The pHAT DAC provides a high-quality digital to analog audio converter for the Raspberry Pi: 24-bits at 192KHz via the I2S interface on the 2x20 pin GPIO header. It has a 3.5mm stereo jack pre-assembled and can accommodate an optional RCA phono connector.

Though designed to match the format of the Raspberry Pi Zero it is compatible with all 40-pin GPIO Raspberry Pi variants (2/B+/A+/Zero).

To get the pHAT DAC set up and ready to go you can use the one-line product installer:

```bash
curl -sS https://get.pimoroni.com/phatdac | bash
```
