# Pinout!

## The Raspberry Pi GPIO pinout guide.

This GPIO Pinout is an interactive reference to the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins, and a guide to the Raspberry Pi's GPIO interfaces. Pinout also includes [hundreds of pinouts for Raspberry Pi add-on boards, HATs and pHATs](/boards).

## Other Pinouts

We've created Pinouts for the Raspberry Pi Pico range of boards, too, you can find them here:

* [Raspberry Pi Pico Pinout](https://pico.pinout.xyz)
* [Raspberry Pi Pico W Pinout](https://picow.pinout.xyz)
* [Raspberry Pi Pico 2 Pinout](https://pico2.pinout.xyz)

And some advanced/experimental pinouts, too:

* [Minimal Raspberry Pi 40-pin Pinout](https://pi.pinout.xyz)
* [Raspberry Pi RP2350A QFN-60 Pinout](https://rp2350a.pinout.xyz)
* [Raspberry Pi RP2350B QFN-80 Pinout](https://rp2350b.pinout.xyz)
* [Espressif ESP32 C5 DevKitC Pinout](https://esp32c5.pinout.xyz)
* [Espressif ESP32 C3 DevKitC Pinout](https://esp32c3.pinout.xyz)
* [PJRC Teensy 4.0 Pinout](https://teensy40.pinout.xyz)

## pHAT Stack

Pinout has teamed up with Pimoroni to create a [prototype board compatibility tool, check it out here!](/phatstack)

## Explore HATs & pHATs

[Check out Pinout's board explorer](/boards)! Use it to find the pinout for your Raspberry Pi add-on board, or discover new boards. If you manufacture boards, we'd love to add yours too. [You can contribute to Pinout.xyz at GitHub.com](https://github.com/pinout-xyz/Pinout.xyz).

## What do these numbers mean?

* GPIO - General Purpose Input/Output, aka "BCM" or "Broadcom". These are the big numbers, e.g. "GPIO 22". You'll use these with RPi.GPIO and GPIO Zero.
* Physical - or "Board" correspond to the pin's physical location on the header. These are the small numbers next to the header, e.g. "Physical Pin 15".
* WiringPi - for Gordon Henderson's Wiring Pi library. These are shown as a tooltip when you mouseover a pin.
* Rev 1 Pi - alternate GPIO/BCM numbers for the original, 26-pin model "A" and "B" Pi.

## What's the orientation of this pinout?

Pinout depicts pin 1 in the top left corner. Pin 1 is the only pin with a square solder pad, which may only be visible from the underside of your Pi. If you orient your Pi such that you are looking at the top with the GPIO on the right and HDMI port(s) on the left, your orientation will match Pinout.

## Graphical Pinout

We've whipped up a simple graphical Raspberry Pi GPIO Pinout. Feel free to print, embed, share or hotlink this image and don't forget to credit us!
