# AIY Voice HAT

The AIY Voice HAT connects the Raspberry Pi to the Google Assistant and is part of Google's AIY Voice Kit V1. It was created with the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B in mind but may be used with any Raspberry Pi featuring a 40-way header, such as the Raspberry Pi Zero.

The HAT includes on-board hardware to facilitate audio capture and playback, connectors for the dual mic daughter board and speaker, GPIO breakouts to connect low-voltage components like micro-servos and sensors, and an optional barrel connector for dedicated power supply.

**Note:** If you have the AIY Voice Kit V2, instead see the [Voice Bonnet](/pinout/aiy_voice_bonnet), which is the smaller pHAT version of this board.
