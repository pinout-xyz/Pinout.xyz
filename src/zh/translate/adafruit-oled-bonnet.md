# OLED Bonnet

The OLED Bonnet is a simple 128x64 display for the Raspberry pi with a 5-way joystick and 2 push buttons.

The 1.3" screen is made of a 128x64 individual white OLED pixels and because the display makes its own light, no backlight is required. This reduces the power required to run the OLED and is why the display has such high contrast.

To install the necessary software, use the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get install git python-imaging python-smbus
git clone https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_SSD1306
cd Adafruit_Python_SSD1306
sudo python setup.py install
```
