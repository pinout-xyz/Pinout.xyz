# AIY Voice Bonnet

The AIY Voice Bonnet comes with the AIY Voice Kit V2 by Googleâ€”a do-it-yourself intelligent speaker. The Voice Bonnet connects to your Raspberry Pi to create a natural language processor that can respond to your voice and connect to the Google Assistant.

The bonnet includes hardware to facilitate audio capture and playback, stereo speaker terminals, a headphone jack, an 8-pin button connector, UART breakout pins, and 4 unique GPIO pins called `PIN_A`, `PIN_B`, `PIN_C`, and `PIN_D`.

**Note:** If you have the AIY Voice Kit V1, instead see the [Voice Hat](/pinout/voice_hat), which is the full-size HAT version of this board.
