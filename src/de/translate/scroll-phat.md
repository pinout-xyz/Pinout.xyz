# Scroll pHAT

The Scroll pHAT provides a matrix of 55 white LED pixels that is ideal for writing messages, showing graphs, and drawing pictures. Perfect for RPi Zero but works with A+/B+/2 too!

To get the pHAT set up and ready to go you can use the one-line product installer:

```bash
curl -sS https://get.pimoroni.com/scrollphat | bash
```

Then import it into your Python script and start tinkering:

```bash
import scrollphat
```
