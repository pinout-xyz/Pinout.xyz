# Real-Time HAT

Real-Time HAT extends the Gigabit-Ethernet interface of the Raspberry Pi, adding professional networking functions.
Typical applications are **industrial real-time communication** and **network monitoring**.

The HAT provides **3 Gigabit-Ethernet ports**, one of which is connected to the Raspberry Pi's Ethernet port.
Connection to the Raspberry Pi is realized via the GPIO connector and via a (short) Ethernet cable. The SPI0 interface is used for main configuration, using either CE0# or CE1#.

Additional information on use cases, programming interfaces etc. can be found on [InnoRoute's website](https://innoroute.com/realtimehat/), which includes details on using the HAT as an **endpoint in Time-Sensitive Networks**, as a **3-port Ethernet switch**, or to **measure and monitor** any kind of the traffic forwarded through the HAT.

To install the necessary software, use the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/InnoRoute/RealtimeHAT
cd RealtimeHAT
./install.sh
```
