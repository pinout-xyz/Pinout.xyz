# NadHAT v1

NadHAT v1 is a GSM/GPRS modem pHAT for the Raspberry Pi, based on the Simcom SIM800C standard module. It's Gammu and pppd compatible for SMS and DATA exchange.

It has a timekeeper with CR1225 coin cell, one 10bit ADC channel, 2 status LEDS and an efficient switched-mode DC/DC converter. It needs a micro sim card line subscriber to work with it.

To install the necessary software, use the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get install minicom python-dev python-setuptools
sudo apt-get install python-serial python-pip git
sudo pip install wiringpi
sudo apt-get install wiringpi
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/garatronic/nadhat
cd nadhat/software
./nadpwr.sh
```
