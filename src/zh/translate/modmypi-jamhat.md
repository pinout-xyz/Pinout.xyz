# Jam Hat

An LED, button and buzzer hat ideal for Raspberry Jams, Jam Makers and people learning the basics of GPIO.

The Hat has 6 LEDs, 2 buttons and a tonal buzzer allowing for lots of hardware experimentation using the GPIO Zero library for ease of use.
```
from gpiozero import JamHat
from time import sleep

jh = JamHat()

# Turn the hat on, wait and turn it off.
jh.on()
sleep(1)
jh.off()

# Play tones through the buzzer.
jh.buzzer.play('C4')
sleep(0.5)
jh.buzzer.play('D4')
sleep(0.5)
jh.buzzer.play('E4')
sleep(0.5)
jh.off()

# Use the buttons to turn on lights.
jh.button_1.when_pressed = jh.lights_1.on
jh.button_1.when_released = jh.lights_1.off
jh.button_2.when_pressed = jh.lights_2.on
jh.button_2.when_released = jh.lights_2.off
```
