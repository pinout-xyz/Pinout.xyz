#1 Wire Pi Zero

The 1 Wire Pi Zero from AB Electronics UK is a communication board supporting the 1-Wire® protocol designed for use on the Raspberry Pi Zero.  A 5V buffered I2C port is also provided on the board. 

The 1-Wire® port on the 1 Wire Pi Zero is based around a DS2482-100 I2C to 1-Wire® bridge device.  The DS2482-100 provides bi-directional protocol conversion between the I2C port on the Raspberry Pi and any attached 1-Wire® slave devices.  An ESD Protection Diode is used to protect the 1 Wire Pi Zero and Raspberry Pi from electrostatic spikes on the 1-Wire® port.  Connections to the 1-Wire® port can be made through the RJ-12 socket or the solder points on the PCB.

I2C address select solder jumpers give you the ability to set the I2C address of the 1 Wire Pi Zero allowing the board to be used with other I2C devices on the same bus.
