# PiTFT Plus 3.5"

The PiTFT+ features a 3.5" display with 480x320 16-bit color pixels and a resistive touch overlay and is engineered specifically to work with the Raspberry Pi 3, 2 and the Model A+/B+.

The display uses the hardware SPI pins as well as GPIO #25 and #24. GPIO #18 can be used to PWM dim the backlight. A 2x13 'classic' GPIO header on the bottom, with additional GPIO pins broken out into solder pads, allows you to use more of the GPIO.

The PiTFT+ can be used as a display for running the X interface, or the console. You can also have an HDMI display separately connected to complement the setup, keeping in mind that there can only be one X session running (so you'll need to choose where X should be output, on the HDMI or the PiTFT+).
