# ADC Pi

The ADC Pi is an 8 channel 17 bit analogue to digital converter designed to work with the Raspberry Pi. The ADC Pi is based on two Microchip MCP3424 A/D converters each containing 4 analogue inputs.  The MCP3424 is a delta-sigma A/D converter with low noise differential inputs.

## Features

- 8 x 17-bit 0 to 5V Single Ended Inputs
- Control via the Raspberry Pi I2C port
- Stack up to 4 ADC Pi boards on a single Raspberry Pi
- Jumper selectable I2C addresses (0x68 to 0x6F)
- Buffered 5V I2C port
- Based on the MCP3424 from Microchip Technologies Inc
- Single Ended full-scale range of 5.0V
- On-board 2.048V reference voltage (Accuracy  ± 0.05%, Drift: 15 ppm/°C)
- On-Board Programmable Gain Amplifier (PGA): Gains of 1, 2, 4 or 8
- Programmable Data Rate Options:
   - 3.75 SPS (17 bits)
   - 15 SPS (15 bits)
   - 60 SPS (13 bits)
   - 240 SPS (11 bits)
- One-Shot or Continuous Conversion Options

Python, C, C++, Node.js and Windows 10 IOT libraries are available on GitHub.
