# Speaker pHAT

Speaker pHAT crams an I2S DAC and mono amplifier, a tiny 8Î© 2W speaker, and a 10 LED bar graph all on a board no bigger than a Pi zero.

Though designed to match the format of the Raspberry Pi Zero it is compatible with all 40-pin GPIO Raspberry Pi variants (2/3/B+/A+/Zero).

To get the Speaker pHAT set up and ready to go you can use the one-line product installer:

```bash
curl -sS https://get.pimoroni.com/speakerphat | bash
```
