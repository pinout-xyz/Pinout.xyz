# Arcade Bonnet

This Adafruit Arcade Bonnet is designed to make small emulator projects a little easier to build. Here are the board's features: 

It is the same size as a Pi Zero, so for really compact builds, this is super small. You can use it with a Pi 2, 3, B+ or any 2x20 connector Pi.

It has JST sockets so you can plug in six arcade buttons easily.

Header breakouts for use with both clicky-type switched joysticks and...

Header breakout and converter for using analog-type joysticks or thumbsticks with potentiometers inside

A 3W speaker output that can drive 4-8 ohm speakers for when using with a TV output, HDMI display or PiTFT.

Switches are all managed with an I2C-GPIO converter with interrupt out. The converter is very fast and frees up all the pins so you can use this Bonnet with a PiTFT or any other accessory/device that uses a lot of pins!
