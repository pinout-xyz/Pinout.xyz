# Navio2 Autopilot

The Navio2 Autopilot is designed both for your own custom robotic projects and as a platform for Linux version of APM (ArduPilot).

Navio2 eliminates the need for multiple on-board controllers making development easier and increasing robustness. It extends connectivity and allows control of all kinds of moving robots: cars, boats, multirotors, planes.

For accurate knowledge of position and orientation Navio2 is equipped with double IMU and GPS/Glonass/Beidou receiver. PWM, ADC, SBUS and PPM are integrated in Linux sysfs via the on-board RC I/O co-processor, allowing easy access from any programming language.

## Features

* MS5611 Barometer (I2C1)
* MPU9250 9DOF IMU (SPI0)
* LSM9DS1 9DOF IMU (SPI0)
* Ublox M8N Glonass/GPS/Beidou (SPI0)
* 14 PWM servo outputs (RCIO/SPI1)
* PPM/S.Bus input (RCIO/SPI1)
* 6-channel ADC (RCIO/SPI1)
* Integrated RGB LED
* UART, I2C terminals for extensions
* Power module connector
* Triple redundant power supply
