# Explorer HAT Pro

5V inputs and outputs, touch pads, LEDs, analog inputs and an H-Bridge motor driver make up the Explorer HAT Pro; a jack of all trades prototyping side-kick for your Raspberry Pi.

To get the HAT set up and ready to go you can use the one-line product installer:

```bash
curl -sS https://get.pimoroni.com/explorerhat | bash
```

Then import it into your Python script and start tinkering:

```bash
import explorerhat
explorerhat.light.on()
```
