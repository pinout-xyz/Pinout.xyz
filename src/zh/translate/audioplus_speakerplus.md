## 2X5W STEREO AMP FOR ONBOARD/EXTERNAL SPEAKERS

* Power your old speaker directly

* No extra power supply required

##Features:

(There is no microphone on this board, for a microphone see our other model MIC+)

1. 2x5w Stereo Amplification 2 onboard speaker included

2. DAC I2s 24-bit audio with studio sampling quality

3. Line out stereo 3.5mm jack

4. Onboard red button, 1 status led

7. Soldered Long female header 2x20 (NO soldering required) Compatible with Raspberry Pi 3, 2, B+, A+, and Zero

## Installation for Raspbian users

* Plug Audio+ firmly on top of your Raspberry Pi GPIO and turn on your Pi

* Open a terminal and type the following to download and run the installer:

```bash
sudo wget -O - script.raspiaudio.com | bash
```

* Say yes TO the reboot

* On the next reboot you have to run the test to finish the installation (it is an ALSA oddness):

```bash
sudo speaker-test -l5 -c2 -t wav
```

* Reboot again and you will be able to control the volume from your desktop or by using the command-line tool `alsamixer`
