# Expander Pi

Expander Pi is a versatile digital and analogue expansion board.  It allows you to connect your Raspberry Pi to switches, lights, sensors, and many other devices giving you a way to communicate with the outside world.

## Features  

8 channel MCP3208 12-bit ADC with a maximum sample rate of 100 ksps and includes a 4.096 volt precision voltage reference.  
2 channel MCP4822 12-bit DAC with an internal voltage reference.  
16 digital I/O channels, using an MCP23017 16-bit I/O expander with a maximum input of 5 volts on each channel.
A Real Time Clock using a DS1307 RTC and a CR2032 battery to maintain the date and time when the main system power is not available.

Python, C, C++, Node.js and Windows 10 IOT libraries are available on GitHub.
