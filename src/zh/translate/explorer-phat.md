# Explorer pHAT

5V inputs and outputs, analog inputs and an H-Bridge motor driver make up the Explorer pHAT; a jack of all trades prototyping side-kick for your Raspberry Pi. Perfect for RPi Zero but works with A+/B+/2 too!

To get the pHAT set up and ready to go you can use the one-line product installer:

```bash
curl -sS https://get.pimoroni.com/explorerhat | bash
```

Then import it into your Python script and start tinkering:

```bash
import explorerhat
```
