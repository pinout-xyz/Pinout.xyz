[Pinout.xyz](http://pinout.xyz/) is the successor to the popular Pi pinout website originally hosted on [http://pi.gadgetoid.com/pinout](http://pi.gadgetoid.com/pinout).

To support translation efforts, and allow people to build documentation and tools with the data in this repository, Pinout.xyz is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

The license was previously explicitly non-commercial, to understand why it has been changed please see: https://github.com/pinout-xyz/Pinout.xyz/issues/481

This license includes the 'pinout-graphic-horizontal' files located in the `graphics` directory and the 'pi-orientation' graphic located in `resources`, which are provided to permit commercial use; specifically publication in books and magazines with appropriate attribution.

The license excludes all board photography which has been supplied by manufacturers or customers via PR without any explicit license grant, or supplied under the implicit permission of my (@Gadgetoid) employment at Pimoroni. Re-use of product photography is normally assumed to be implicitly permitted for resale or promotional purposes, but I cannot pass a nebulous, implicit license on for re-use. YMMV.

If you copy and re-use this website henceforth, I would prefer full attribution in the page footer, for example:

Based on <a href="https://pinout.xyz">Pinout.xyz</a> created by <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@gadgetoid">@gadgetoid.</a>
Maintained by @yourname, contribute at https://github.com/yourname/yourfork

If you're a commercial venture, or closely associated, I would also appreciate, but do not require, that you review Pinout's funding options and maybe chuck me a bone!

# About this project

The contents of this GitHub repository are used to build http://pinout.xyz and its translated subdomains.

This project aims to build a consistent workflow behind the Pinout.xyz front-end, gather useful information about the Raspberry Pi GPIO interface and add-on boards, and invite board manufacturers to produce their own "overlay" files which describe which pins their Pi add-ons use.

We hope that by making this project open and extensible we will invite not only contributions of board pinouts, but translations too.

# Reporting Issues & Making Suggestions

If you've spotted an error, ommission or have a suggestion, raise an [issue](https://github.com/pinout-xyz/Pinout.xyz/issues). Feedback on every aspect of the site or this repository is welcome!

# Contributing

If you have a board you'd like to contribute, the preferred method for submission is to create a modified version of the overlay [template](https://github.com/pinout-xyz/Pinout.xyz/blob/master/draft/overlay/template.md) and create a pull request. Please ensure the files you submit are being pushed to the `/draft` folder, where it will be reviewed before publication.

Note that as part of the submission, a top-down view of the board in the form of a [png](https://github.com/pinout-xyz/Pinout.xyz/blob/master/draft/boards/template.png) is expected. If you can't produce the png file yourself, just duplicate and rename `template.png` but make sure to include a url somewhere in the overlay where we can fetch a suitable graphic.

Once your draft has been made, before filing a pull request, you should try to render the page and make sure it build and appears as intended. To do so:

```bash
./draft/publish.sh myboard
make serve LANG=en
```

And then open: http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser.

Once you are happy with the result, 

```bash
./draft/unpublish.sh myboard
```
(this will file the overlay back into the draft folder, ready for review)

*note 1: you will need several python modules installed on your system to render and serve a local version of the site, run*  
*`pip install -r requirements.txt` from the top of the repository tree to install the required modules.*

*note 2: if you are facing issues with your preview (board not showing, text update not appearing, etc.), you can fix it by erasing your browser's cache (image and cache file only).*

If you feel that the requirements for submissions is beyond your current possibilities, you may raise an [issue](https://github.com/pinout-xyz/Pinout.xyz/issues) requesting the addition of a specific board instead and we'll consider it!


## Running in Docker

The webserver can also be run in a Docker container. To do this, you first need to build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t pinout.xyz .
```

Next, you can start the containerized webserver:

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 -e PINOUT_LANG=en pinout.xyz
```

Now you can access the webserver at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

# Translating

If you would like to provide support for a language not yet in the repository you should start by duplicating the `src/en` directory to the appropriate [language-code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes). For example, if you want to create a Czech translation you would create the folder `src/cs`. Note that there are no plans to support cultures (it would just get out of hand), so you can't have `src/fr-CA` (sorry!).

The first resources we recommend you translate are the language-specific strings found in the `settings.yaml` file, `pi-pinout.md`, `index.md`, `404.md` and the `footer.html` template, as well as the content of the `/pin` folder, preferably.

Once that's done, rename the `/overlay` folder to `/translate` and start translating the boards markdown files (pick any you fancy translating, it does not have to be the first board in alphabetical order). Leave those translations in the `/translate` folder when finished.

Please do not attempt to translate the `/resources` folder, or anything not specifically mentioned in this section of the README - all files outside your *&lt;languagecode&gt;* directory are shared between the subdomains and are meant to be generic. Feel free to modify the template with links relevant to your country, and / or your Twitter handle however, but don't fiddle with the structure!

Once you've made your translation, you can build and preview it with, for example:

```bash
make serve LANG=de
```

And then open: http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser.

The last step will be to submit your finished translation as a [pull request](https://github.com/pinout-xyz/Pinout.xyz/pulls) (this can include any number of boards, it does not have to be the entire line-up) and we'll get it live on its own *&lt;languagecode&gt;*.pinout.xyz subdomain.

If you wish to provide a translation for an existing subdomain, or correct a typo in an existing markdown file, just edit the file in place (leaving the files in the `translate` folder for review, if you are pushing a translation).

If you have a question about translations, raise an [issue](https://github.com/pinout-xyz/Pinout.xyz/issues) and we'll be happy to help you get past whatever hurdle you may face!


# Roadmap &amp; wishlist

* Redesign HTML generation and unify HTML templates into a single, translatable file
* Add functionality to compare two or more boards, to visualise pin compatibility
* Tool to convert WiringPi to GPIO to BCM and back
* Add as many [boards](http://pinout.xyz/boards) as possible!
