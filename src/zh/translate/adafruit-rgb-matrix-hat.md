# RGB Matrix HAT + RTC
 
This HAT plugs into your Pi and makes it super easy to control RGB matrices such as those you see in the likes of Times square enabling you to create a colourful scrolling display or mini LED wall with ease. A 5V power supply is also required, not included, for powering the matrix itself. The Pi cannot do it due to the high currents. To calculate the max current of your matrix set up, multiply the width of all the chained matrix by 0.12 : A 32 pixel wide matrix needs 32*0.12 = 3.85A so pick up a 5V 4A power supply. Please note: this HAT is only for use with HUB75 type RGB Matrices. Not for use with NeoPixel, DotStar, or other 'addressable' LEDs.

## Features

Simple design - plug in power, plug in IDC cable, run our Python code!
Power protection circuitry - you can plug a 5V 4A wall adapter into the HAT and it will automatically protect against negative, over or under-voltages! Yay for no accidental destruction of your setup.
Onboard level shifters to convert the RasPi's 3.3V to 5.0V logic for clean and glitch free matrix driving

DS1307 Real Time Clock can keep track of time for the Pi even when it is rebooted or powered down, to make for really nice time displays

To install:

 ```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python-dev python-imaging
wget https://github.com/adafruit/rpi-rgb-led-matrix/archive/master.zip
unzip master.zip
cd rpi-rgb-led-matrix-master/
make
 ```
