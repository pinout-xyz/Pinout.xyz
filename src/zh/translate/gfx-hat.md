# GFX HAT

GFX HAT uses both SPI and I2c to drive the LCD display, back-light and touch. However both of these busses can be shared with other devices.

To get the HAT set up and ready to go you can use the one-line product installer:

```bash
curl -sS https://get.pimoroni.com/gfxhat | bash
```

And follow the instructions!
